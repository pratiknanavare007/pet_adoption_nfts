# 🐾 Pet Adoption NFTs

## 📄 Description

**Pet Adoption NFTs** is a simple smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain using Move. It enables animal shelters or pet owners to register pets available for adoption and allows users to adopt them. Once adopted, users receive a unique, simulated NFT representing their new pet.

This contract acts as a lightweight simulation of NFT minting and can be extended to interact with Aptos’s official NFT standards in the future.

## 🌟 Vision

Our vision is to create a transparent, tamper-proof pet adoption system that:

* Encourages digital ownership and responsibility.
* Builds verifiable adoption histories on-chain.
* Connects pet shelters to a wider audience via the blockchain.

By leveraging the decentralized nature of Aptos, this platform ensures integrity in the adoption process and provides a meaningful NFT to commemorate the event.

## 🚀 Future Scope

* 🔗 **Integration with Aptos Token/NFT Standard** for real NFT minting and trading.
* 📸 **Pet Metadata Support** including images, breed, age, vaccination details.
* 🌍 **Pet Marketplace UI** for users to browse available pets and initiate adoptions via a friendly interface.
* 🧾 **Adoption History** for each user, showing all past adopted pets.
* 🤝 **Multi-party Consent** for co-adoption or shelter approvals.
